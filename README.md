# 🏹 **SURVIVOR’S ECHO**  
*A 3D Survival Experience — Where Every Second Counts.*

Welcome to **Survivor’s Echo**, a 3D open-world survival game where nature is beautiful, resources are scarce, and **you are very, very alone.**  
Cut trees. Hunt. Craft tools. Build shelter. Fight hunger.  
And most importantly…

**Survive.**

## 🌍 **Game Overview**

You wake up in a vast wilderness with nothing but your instincts.  
The environment is your enemy, your friend, your teacher — and eventually, your grave… unless you adapt.

### 🧭 Core Mechanics
- 🌲 **Resource Gathering** – Wood, stone, minerals… if you can find it, you can use it.
- 🔨 **Crafting System** – Tools, weapons, shelters, fire… survival depends on what you build.
- 🏚️ **Base Building** – From a fragile hut to a fortified camp.
- 🐺 **Wildlife AI** – Hunt… and avoid being hunted.
- 🌧️ **Weather & Day/Night Cycle** – Cold nights are not your friend.
- ⚔️ **Combat & Stealth** – Sometimes, running is smarter than fighting.
